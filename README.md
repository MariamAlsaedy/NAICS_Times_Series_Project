# NAISC_Times_Series_Project

There was an Arab investor who decided to invest his money in North American countries, specifically in three countries:
Canada, Mexico, and the United States
But he didn't know in which industry he would invest all that money
He decided to use a data analyst to help him make his decision
The analyst realized that these countries use a system called the NAICS Classification
Which depends on its definition of a given code for each industry in a hierarchical system
This analyst started collecting data on this system from 1997 to 2018
Then the analysis began
Which discovered that one of the most important and largest industries that are held in those countries
It is the construction industry, followed  by food services
This is because the number of employees and its employees was increasing over time according to his analysis of that time series
The data analyst came back and told him what he had concluded:
If he wants to invest in a large industry that employs many people and can open many branches, then he should turn to the construction industry.
But if he wants a medium-sized industry with a kind of entertainment, he should open a chain of restaurants or cafes
The investor thought and made his decision...
And you, what would your decision be if you was in his place?
